                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our project provides an accessible, multimodal art experience for William Herbert "Buck" Dunton's painting, <i>Black Bears in Aspen</i>. 
                        In this part of the Fine Arts Center, visitors with visual disabilities are able engage through touch, sound, scent, 
                        and descriptive language. Features include a tactile replica of our painting, an accompanying scent that reflects the artist's theme, an 
                        ambient soundscape enhancing the mood, and an audio narration explaining what the art entails. Visitors can also access written descriptions 
                        in both Braille and large print, along with a texture key that maps elements to parts of the painting. Overall, this immersive setup promotes 
                        deeper, more inclusive engagement for all users.

                    <p>
                        We read and watched 4 academic research papers, 3 online articles, and 1 YouTube video for our needfinding process. We then created an 
                        affinity diagram using the needs that we discovered in our research. The affinity diagram categorizes the needs into larger groups.

                                Art is mainly explored through touch, but not other avenues

                                The design model for the tactile should be simple and abstract enough for easy understandability, while also not avoiding oversimplification of the art

                    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following our convergent sketch, we created an initial prototype of the 3D model. The input we received from the testers of our prototype led us to decide to put the textures on 
                        top of the model along with them being in the legend. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Prototype</h3>
                    <img src="media/prototype.jpeg" alt="The initial prototype of the 3D model. It looks like a 3D printed height map of the painting Black Bears in Aspen."/>

                    <h3>Final Model</h3>
                    <img src="media/final_model.JPG" alt="The final version of the 3D model. It is the same 3D printed height map with several textures on top including fur, fake grass, shredded paper, and fake branches and leaves."/>

                    <h3>Finished Project</h3>
                    <img src="media/finished_project.jpg" alt="Our finished project. It includes from left to right a speaker that plays associated sounds, a scent box, the 3D model, and the legend with textures from the 3D model with labels."/>

                    <h3> Design Choices </h3>
                    <p> 
                        Our design principles were informed through the wants of people who are visually impaired through our research. We decided to create a multi-modal 
                        experience for a plethora of reasons. Multiple studies say that they want multiple options to experience art, to have the autonomy to experience it 
                        themselves, to have a fully immersive experience, and to explore art through other avenues besides tactile pathways, especially since people have 
                        their preferences (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/4/470">Cho, 2021</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586076">Maćkowski et. al, 2023</a>, 
                        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580941">Mingzhe Li et. al, 2023</a>). We chose to make a 3D printed version of Dunton’s painting. People 
                        have reported that tactile graphics are difficult to interpret, especially if the paintings are complex (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586076">Maćkowski et. al, 2023</a>) which is why we decided 
                        to add texture on the 3D painting to make it easier for blind people to identify what each object is. Furthermore, we are addressing the issue that tactile 
                        paintings are rare to come across (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580941">Mingzhe Li et. al, 2023</a>) by making a tactile version of our painting. We are creating an audio descriptive guide 
                        specifically made for people without sight (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580941">Mingzhe Li et. al, 2023</a>). There is also a smell of the environment of the painting as well as sound of the 
                        environment for a more immersive experience (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/4/470">Cho, 2021</a>). This addresses other issues such as tours being available only at specific times and days 
                        (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586076">Maćkowski et. al, 2023</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580941"> Mingzhe Li et. al, 2023</a>). By having this information constantly present in front of the painting, it gives blind people autonomy 
                        and it makes it more defining for blind people to remember the paintings (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586076">Maćkowski et. al, 2023</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580941">Mingzhe Li et. al, 2023</a>).

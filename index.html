                    <p>
                        Our project provides an accessible, multimodal art experience for William Herbert "Buck" Dunton's painting, “Black Bears in Aspen.” 
                        In this part of the Fine Arts Center, visitors with both visual and cognitive disabilities are able engage through touch, sound, scent, 
                        and descriptive language. Features include a tactile replica of our painting, an accompanying scent that reflects the artist's theme, an 
                        ambient soundscape enhancing the mood, and an audio narration explaining what the art entails. Visitors can also access written descriptions 
                        in both Braille and large print, along with a texture key that maps elements to parts of the painting. Overall, this immersive setup promotes 
                        deeper, more inclusive engagement for all users.

                    <h2>Needfinding</h2>
                    <p>
                        We read/watched 4 academic research papers, 3 online articles and 1 YouTube video for our needfinding process. We then created an 
                        affinity diagram using the needs that we discovered in our research. The affinity diagram categorizes the needs into larger groups.

                                The design model for the tactile should be simple and abstract enough for easy understandability, while also not avoiding oversimplification of the art

                        Based on the groups from our affinity diagram, we each made 2 divergent sketches containing potential solutions to some or all of the identified 
                        needs. Finally, we combined the best ideas from our divergent sketches for our one convergent sketch.

Our project provides a tactile, sonic, and olfactory experience for the user. It is based on William Herbert Dunting’s 
painting Black Bears in Aspen. We can start by picking up the 3D model to feel textures as well as the locations of them within the painting.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:23.000
The 3D model is a 3D printed height map of the painting with several textures pasted on top of it including fake branches, leaves, fur, rocks, grass, and bushes.


00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.000
There is also a legend that is clearly labeled with a large font and has braille. All of the textures that appear in the 3D model are in the legend with the same labeling.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:39.000
If you want to listen to an audio description of the painting, it is available. The description provides an overview of the prominent features of the painting as well as its format. 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.000
You’ll notice that there are noises playing in the background including ambient forest noises, footsteps, and a bear breathing.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Finally we can go ahead and put our nose up to the scent box to smell a subtle nature-associated smell. The smell is meant to be similar to what would be smelled at the location of the painting.
